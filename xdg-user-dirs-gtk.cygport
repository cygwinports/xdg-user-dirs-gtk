SUMMARY="GNOME xdg-user-dirs frontend"
DESCRIPTION="xdg-user-dirs-gtk is a companion to xdg-user-dirs that integrates
it into the Gnome desktop and Gtk+ applications.  It gets run during login and
does two things: tracks changes of locale and prompts the user so the
directories can be changed, and creates a default gtk bookmarks file if there
is none, based on a set of xdg user dirs."
